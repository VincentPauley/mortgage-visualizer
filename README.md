# Mortgage Visualizer

When using online tools to calculate monthly mortgage payments, I find the experience
very clunky to check different rates and house prices and compare. This is my personal
UI helper for tracking various different mortgages against each other.

## Disclaimer

I am not a Realtor or financial adviser, the underlying caclculations are based on formulas
I found online - please understand a lot more goes into calculating payments than what I have here.
